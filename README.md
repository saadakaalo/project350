# A crowdsourced peer-reviewed online question-bank



## Reason behind this project:

The poor quality of the questions in village-level school make the “Srijonshil” academic system very difficult for the students. Hopefully a crowdsourced peer-reviewed online question-bank can improve this situation.


## Our project’s functionalities:

Enthusiastic question creators from different parts of the country can voluntarily create creative questions.
End users like school teachers form village can browse the questions. They can take questions from here and modify it. Or they can just use this question as an idea for creating his own questions.
Reviewers among the creator will review the questions uploaded. They will comment for modification and they can press like and dislike button. Based on their reviews the questions will be added into the question bank.
The admins will control the registration of the users. The will check background of the user after registration and accept his registration. They also can ban some user. This will keep the system fraud-proof. 
There will be a rating system for the creators and reviewers.


## Our project’s users:

* Admins: They will control the acceptance and denial of the registration of other users. They can ban other users. They will make some question creators reviewer.
* Question creators: They will create questions. Our expected user group of this group in students from different universities and teachers.
* Reviewers: Question creators with higher rating will be added to this group by the admins.
* Normal users: They will browse the questions for creating question. They can modify or use this as an example for this question. Our expected users of the group are the teachers from different schools for creating questions.


## How this project will be usable:

If the number of questions of the question bank is low, then the students can easily solve all the questions and make this system unusable. But as the number of questions will grow, this will be extremely difficult for the students to solve all questions and find common. Also the end users will be instructed not to copy questions directly, rather modify the questions or use it as a reference for his question.
